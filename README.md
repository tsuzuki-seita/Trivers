Players can switch between attributes at any time.
The enemies are three different enemy mobs for each of the three attributes.

# Features

Enemy movement is achieved using state-based AI.
This has enabled the movement of the enemy to change according to the situation.

# Requirement

* Unity 2020.2.7f1

# Note

I don't test environments under Linux and Windows.
